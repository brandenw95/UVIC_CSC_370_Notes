#### Q1

> Order by total goals descending.

```SQL

FROM england

ORDER BY totgoal DESC;

#### Q2

> For each total goal result, find how many games had that result.
> Use the England table and consider only the seasons since 1980.
> Order by total goal.

```SQL

FROM england
WHERE season >= 1980
GROUP BY totgoal
ORDER BY totgoal;

#### Q3

> Find for each team in England in tier 1 the total number of games played since 1980.
> Report only teams with at least 300 games.
>
> Hint. Find the number of games each team has played as "home".
> Find the number of games each team has played as "visitor".
> Then union the two and take the sum of the number of games.

#### Q4

> For each pair team1, team2 in England, in tier 1,
> find the number of home-wins since 1980 of team1 versus team2.
> Order the results by the number of home-wins in descending order.
>
> Hint. After selecting the tuples needed (... WHERE tier=1 AND ...) do a GROUP BY home, visitor.

#### Q6

> For each pair team1, team2 in England in tier 1 report the number of home-wins and away-wins
> since 1980 of team1 versus team2.
> Order the results by the number of away-wins in descending order.
>
> Hint. Join the results of the two previous queries. To do that you can use those
> queries as subqueries. Remove their ORDER BY clause when making them subqueries.
> Be careful on the join conditions.

#### Q9

> One of the beliefs many people have about Italian soccer teams is that they play much more defense than offense.
> Catenaccio or The Chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence.
> In Italian, catenaccio means "door-bolt", which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence
> focused on nullifying opponents' attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities.
> In this question we would like to see whether the number of goals in Italy is on average smaller than in England.
>
> Find the average total goals per season in England and Italy since the 1970 season.
> The results should be (season, england_avg, italy_avg) triples, ordered by season.
>
> Hint.
> Subquery 1: Find the average total goals per season in England.
> Subquery 2: Find the average total goals per season in Italy
>    (there is no totgoal in table Italy. Take hgoal+vgoal).
> Join the two subqueries on season.

#### Q10

> Find the number of games in France and England in tier 1 for each goal difference.
